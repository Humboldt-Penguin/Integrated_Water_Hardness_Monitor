# Integrated Water Hardness Monitor

Final project for Fall 2021 Honors Introduction to Engineering.

When this code is uploaded to an Arduino and used in conjunction with a CQRobot TDS Sensor, you can measure the hardness of water in mg/L.

Functions for the TDS meter taken from [CQRobot Wiki](http://www.cqrobot.wiki/) under the entry "TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) Meter Sensor SKU: CQRSENTDS01".
